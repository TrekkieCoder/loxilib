## What is loxilib

loxilib is a standalone golang package providing utility routines like lpm, networking utils, counters, logging etc. Originally designed to work only with [loxilb](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb), it can now be used with any golang project. It exports functionality not found usually in other standard golang packages.
